Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\n\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. \nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. \nTherefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like \"to live like a true Barcelonian\".  \n\nQuerida Isa, muchas gracias por tu hospedalid génial! Volveré a ciencia cierta!\nSaludos y besos\nLiliana",

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \n\nIt's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called \"Barcelona lockers\". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day. \n\n",

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. \nThe street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on \"the right side\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.

Nos proveyó de un matress de aire para nuestra amiga que vino de M.A. y se quedó una noche con nosotros. El barrio nos pareció bien, no tuvimos ningún incidente. Muchos puertoriqueños y Dominicanos, así que nos sentimos como en casa. Todo fue muy cómodo y limpio. Los vecinos hicieron mucho ruido en las noches, pero no fue problema para nosotros.

It was clean and well prepared for us. \nRegarding the neighborhood, it is very close to Taksim square and Istiklal Street with few minutes walk.

Cynthia's condo is the penthouse and is set right on the beach so we were treated to gorgeous Hawaiian sunsets every night, as well as being able to see turtles and whales from our balcony. The condo is beautifully presented and very well equipped - we could not have asked for anything more for our nine day stay. \r\nMahalo Cynthia ",

It was really easy to run up to the Condo for my 9-month old nap times or a quick snack, without being too separated from the family.  The onsite pools, restaurant and of course restaurant/bar became our home bases for the week.  Miso Phat Sushi (across the street) and Maui Brewing were awesome near-by/within walking distance restaurants.  My family and I can't stop bragging about our trip and what a wonderful family/group set-up this Condo is!

Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\n\nThe householder didn't tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder. I doubt that they are on the business to play trick with me.\n\nBarcelona is a really nice city to travel, but this experience does make a bad impression on me. \n ",

L'aria condizionata funzionava e rinfrescava bene tutto l'appartamento. L'unico problemino c'è stato con la porta del bagno che è stato facile chiudere, ma non più riaprire, ma c'è stato subito un pronto intervento da parte dei responsabili dell'appartamento, che hanno aiutato ad uscire la persona che era rimasta chiusa all'interno. Salvo questo però Il quartiere era tranquillo , c'erano vari baretti attorno e anche dei piccoli centri commerciali ( di tipo alimentare ). Era in oltre possibile raggiungere a piedi vari bar dove potersi divertire. I taxi per arrivare nel centro della movida variano con i prezzi dai 5 ai 7 euro a corsa. La fermata della metro era a 5 min a piedi dall'appartamento. Dal centro partiva una navetta che portava direttamente all'aeroporto per soli 4 euro e 90. ",

I would only say that the check out time of 11am is a bit early, especially for a city when you can have dinner quite late... although upon our request, Regina allowed us nicely to stay until 12pm.\r\nThey were two sets of keys which was very convenient for a big group. \r\nI have suggested to regina that it would be great to have a few more amenities provided such as toilet paper and coffee/tea for example, but overall we were very pleased with our stay at Regina's place.

There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi!

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).  Overall, the apartment was a nice, comfortable bargain for family travel - not the most modern, but charming and fully met our needs.",

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host's guidance.\r\n\r\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \r\n\r\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn't use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There's wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn't watch the few channels we wanted to. \r\n\r\nIt's a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you're a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \r\n\r\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\r\n\r\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn't mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)",

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \"at home.\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn't really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.

There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\r\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\r\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we'd wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\r\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can't wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends. Don't hesitate to stay here.\r\nThanks Orestes, it was fabulous x",

She was kind enough to spend time on the computer, explaining us where to go and how to get there, as well as many important tips that made the difference in our trip. We were lucky to have her.\r\n\r\n",

Alugar um apartamento em outra cidade, outro país, além de ser mais barato do que hotel, possibilita uma maior interação com os moradores locais e um maior conhecimento sobre o seu modo de vida. Como são os supermercados e as padarias, o que vendem ali ? qual é o dia a dia da população?  Além disto não há horário para o café da manhã e posso fazer um lanche ou almoço se não quiser ir a um restaurante.\r\nProcuro trazer as minhas experiências de hospedagem para o meu apartamento, pois quero que o hóspede se sinta confortável, em casa.\r\nAlém de gostar muito de viajar, adoro ler e ouvir música e pretendo com o dinheiro que ganho hospedando, poder me hospedar mais pelo mundo a fora.

        "txt": "Our time in Rio staying at Dejanira's apartment was fantastic, I personally don't think that the photos do the property justice and feel that in person the property is actually bigger! The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn't feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn't the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day's exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \"good morning\" and \"good evening\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira's apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again.",

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn't and they didn't, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren't. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \"doctored up\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it's definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \"this looks nothing like the photos.\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you're paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

Do not believe the other guest review... nothing was doctored up, the furniture was great, we used the AC whenever we wanted to.  There were plenty of sand toys, snorkel gear, etc.  There were no issues.  \n\nMy sister and I were on a quest to see as many turtles on Maui as possible and we saw more than 5 everyday right in front of the condo!  They come and feed on the reef between the hours of 10 am and 3 pm.  Much better than having to drag all of your stuff to the beach and then back.  My husband would be sitting outside on the patio enjoying his coffee and cigar, signal that there was a turtle, and we literally threw on our bathing suits, grabbed the snorkel gear and were in the water in a matter of seconds!  \n\nA total of 4 adults stayed at the condo for over a week and it was cozy but very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.  The beds were comfortable, there were curtains that we could shut to let some breeze in but still have privacy.  The newly done wood-like tile floors were a plus also.  \n\nWe had looked at many condos in this area and in the Kihei area and we are so glad we chose this one.  Francesco was also so easy to work with, always responded quickly when we had questions.  Could not have asked for a better host.",

Just outside the condo complex are stores, restaurants and a small local farmers market. \nFRANCESCO was great to work with, giving detailed information about things to do, places to go, etc. \nNo question, this place earns 5 stars and we will stay here again!

        "txt": "I would generally recommend staying at this Maui Airbnb. We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you'll have to get your own. Anyway, over all, a really great place - great location and a nice quiet spot in Maui. :)",

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\n\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won’t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There’s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier.",

Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn't able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private.

I teach middle school math at an international school here in Hong Kong and have enjoyed the lifestyle of living and working in this vibrant city. \r\n\r\nHong Kong has always had plenty of options to stay active. I've played in an expat softball league here for many years and still try to get out as much as I can. When I first arrived, I did a few of the popular hikes, but not so much anymore unfortunately. There are still some places in Hong Kong that I would like to explore and I also find the city to be a great hub for travelling throughout southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nI'm new to Airbnb and open to suggestions on making your stay in Hong Kong an enjoyable experience. Nice to meet you!",

If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. \nWe had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. \nI highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong.

The pool has been perfect for our grandson who is turning 4- he can go underwater and still stand up! We’ve all taken the kitchen scraps to the pig and watched him dominate, used the swings, clothesline, and have great praise for the outside bathroom. There is a high minded curatorial process going on here. Everything feels as if it were chosen for a use in this dreamy world of a bygone time. Thank you for making it possible for us to be here for 6 nights. I am so appreciative of your vision, this feeling of old Hawaii.\nSincerely and with Aloha,\nAnna Marie Hamilton",

The sidewalks are broad and evenly graded which makes for easy walking, and clean.\n\nPublic buses are frequent and easy to use, and there is an underground Metro station nearby within easy walking distance.\n\nDavid was what I would call a super host. His apartment was well equipped with every modern convenience and very clean. It was also very well stocked with food; bread, milk, juice, fresh fruit, butter, coking oil, etc., including a bottle of wine.\n\nHe patiently and carefully explained the works of every appliance in the apartment, including the use of the television features, and he made sure you are aware that he is available for any question later on. Communicating in English was not a problem.\n\nWe greatly appreciated the considerable time he spent providing us with detailed explanation of all the major attractions of Barcelona and how to get there. His Guest Guidebook includes all the details one could possibly ever need while in Barcelona, from managing emergency situations, using public transport, maps, to restaurants, shops, museums and all major attractions. Our visit to Barcelona was made much easier because of the book, and we learned a lot more.\n\nWe would recommend anyone visiting Barcelona to use David's place.

Nos recibió con comida, vino y muchos otros artefactos que fueron indispensables en nuestra estadía allí (shampoo, pasta de dientes, elementos de limpieza). No solo eso sino que también, se tomó el tiempo para explicarnos los lugares que no nos podíamos perder, y los restaurantes a cuales ir.  Fue un placer para nosotros poder conocerlo, y estamos seguros que en nuestros próximos viajes a Barcelona, contactar a David será nuestra primera opción. \n\nEn fin, nuestra estadía en Barcelona fue asombrosa, y gran parte fue gracias a David.

That's reason enough to chose to stay at Centric Boutique at the Beach.  What comes as a bonus is David, a host who takes pride in what he does and who understands that \"goodwill is everything\".  It is no surprise that the owner has been awarded the Tripadvisor Certificate of Excellence.  \n\nDavid keeps in touch, checking in to see if/what there is anything we need, in addition to recommending places to visit.  It's not just lip service.  For example, we suggested he consider adding a mat in the bathtub, which could be a bit slippery.  Later that day, DONE.\n\nFor example, when it was was time to vacate after our ten-day stay, we asked if would do us the favour of arranging for a mini-van to pick us up at 5:30am, as we were taking a train on to San Sebastian, and couldn't risk any misunderstanding if we tried booking this ourselves.  After checking around, David came back with an answer.  The going rate was too high and he was still looking to find us much more reasonable transportation.  He DID.\n\nThis beautifully decorated, two-bedroom apartment is everything as described, well-equipped, well-stocked, clean and comfortable with a lovely balcony and close to all amenities.  \n\nDo we recommend it, most definitely YES.",

Ready to tell us everything. You can ask him about even unexpected things about your stay and be sure he will find an answer in a very short time. How to get to any museum or tourist attraction, where to go in Barcelona,  what to do with kids, where to go to a whole day journey outside the town etc. He's knowledge about Catalonia's history and Catalan architecture is unbelievable. We spending a whole week in Barcelona with our little daughter. She was so happy possessing her own room so she would not go outside. She told us every day she find herself as a princess. She's eight and believe me, she will never said this in our flat. The apartment is amazing. Full of every conveniences you need. Honestly, we haven't got in our own kitchen so many stuff. The apartment is stylish and cosy. So you could feel very comfortable here during your stay. If you need coffee you could make it in many ways, you could cooked here, prepared a dishes, and what it's really really awesome, you could spend a whole evening or night on a lovely terrace. But who wants to stayed on a terrace in Barcelona? If you decided to explore a town, you will find in David's apartment a special guide book which he prepared for his guests. You can't miss it. It's huge as an Encyclopedia Britannica. Neighbours are friendly, you will find a nice bakery and full equipped stores just around the corner. Location is just excellent. Lovely beach is a few blocks from your apartment, underground station just five minutes by walk. Bus stop is on the same corner as a David's apartment. It's hard to believe, but yes. You will find there everything what every high-maintenance resident need. So, if you really want to enjoy your stay at Barcelona, choose this unusual opportunity for living. You will not regret. We are sure! We fell in love with Barcelona, we fell in love with David and we plan to go back as soon as we can. What about next week?",

Perfect for the 2 of us.\r\nTeresa's partner was there to meet us it 12.30am. Let us in, showed us around and offered us a small glass of port and a pastille de nada as a welcome. Very nice.\r\nThe bed is extremely comfortable too. Always a bonus. \r\nLoved this place!\r\nOne small drawback was the noise of passing partygoers in the small hours as the flat is on the a bit of a thoroughfare but seriously not a real problem as the bed was so comfortable we just dozed straight off again.\r\nThe owners checked in with us via test several times over our 3 day stay to make sure we had everything we needed and were all ok.\r\nCan't fault it. We had a great time here. Hope to come back and stay here again sometime very soon\r\n",

Mariana is a fantastic host - really open and friendly,  and generously invited us to use anything in the kitchen and bathroom cupboards.  We would highly recommend Mariana's apartment and Mariana as a host - and would definitely stay here again.",

Maui Vision became a reality and a business starting with my personal condo at the Kihei Akahi Resort C618.\r\n\r\nMaui Vision is a business I love because I get to share the Aloha Spirit, the beauty of the land, and talk story with people from around the world. It is nice to know that we can contribute to someone’s Hawaiian vacation experience in a positive way. We love to hear back from our happy guests.\r\n\r\nI used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.\r\n\r\nI am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.\r\n\r\nI have over 25 years of business administration and customer service experience working for large corporations and high tech startups.\r\n\r\nIf you are in need of a caring Realtor here on Maui, please contact Kathy McCartney RS#77317 of La Costa Realty Hawai’i, LLC Brokerage Lic #18349 .",

        "txt": "This was my first trip to Hawaii and having used Airbnb successfully before, I was looking forward to our stay! While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\n\n\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\"\n\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \"half day rate\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\n\n\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\"\n\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\" by 32\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \"comfortable\", then this might be the place for you.\n\n\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\"  -- \"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\"\n\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \n\n\"This unit is spacious and bright.\"\n\n- Spacious? That's a stretch. But bright? You're absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \n\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \n",

We report this to Tyler, he didn't reply, so we told his friend and then he was arguing with us and he said that I am complaining for no reason. He even suggested me to buy a refresher in Dollar store! \n\nWe were very upset, not only the bad smell, but also the dirty old quilt. We tried to take a nap, but people live on the second floor were laughing so loud and traffic outside was noisy. So we decided to move to a hotel. I asked Tyler about this, he didn't reply, but he sent another friend to reply us that he will give us full refund, and we can leave the key in the room then move to a hotel. But after we arrived at the hotel, Tyler finally replied us and said he won't refund us!

But it meant we made the most of the wonderful harbour beach down the stairs. \nWould highly recommend Beach Escape to large groups. ",

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can't use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \"we push a couple of buttons\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

Not only it is so clean and safe for kids, its convenient location allows us to return for nap and rest when kids are tired between our busy holiday schedules. Wilson is so approachable and very thoughtful in many details.\r\nClean linens, towels, kitchenware, clothes washing powder, indoor storable clothes liner, refills of every consumable daily essential items eg toilet papers, tissues etc.\r\nThere are some stairs upon entry into lobby/lift of the building but it is a very common feature in Hong Kong. You can open the French-door-type glass doors fully before you enter with big luggages. The building guards/administrators on duty are very friendly too.\r\nSurprisingly, it's so quiet and comfortable to sleep, considering its prime location in one of the busiest parts of Hong Kong. Eating, shopping, sightseeing...all within walking distance or so easy for additional transportation when preferred.\r\nThank you for making our stay in Hong Kong so memorable.\r\nStrongly recommended!",

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn't wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn't bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I'm a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place. I mean yes the small restroom is considered as 1 but it was so tiny that we didnt even use the shower in it kus it  was tiny but oh wells. Overall our stay was fine but I did feel like the floors could have been a bit more clean.  ",

Elevators are small and slow, and entrance is directly on a busy street. Wilson is a great host as he was quick to respond to our requests. One of the ACs broke down and was fixed the next day.

Some of them can communicate in English. They are all kind and helpful.\n\nCarmen was super kind and communicative host. Her indication was accurate and helpful. She kindly left an octopus card for visitors to charge and use. \n\nThere is a washing machine in a listing but HongKong was too humid to dry laundry fast.  You can use a laundry shop next to the apartment. They wash and clean your laundry in a day.\n\nThe location was only a few minutes from a tram station. \nWalkable distance from Central and Causeway Bay. \n\nThere are many towns in HongKong but I am totally satisfied with staying in Wanchai. \nWanchai has modern skyscrapers, hipster attractions, and daily local markets and small restaurants.  St Francis street looked very sophisticated and I didn’t feel unsafe. In front of the apartment, there are rainbow stairs which looks like an Instagram shooting spot and a lot of foreign people were taking photos.

If you're a light sleeper, I suggest taking soundproof earplugs with you. \nOtherwise, it's a beautiful apartment if you want to enjoy both the city center of Porto and the beach!",

Despite of my insistance he paid for my dinner, dessert a nice tea afterward and paid for the minibus to the shisha place. Frankly, it might have exceeded the rent I paid. I wanted to go to Kurdistan but non of information was available in English he called the bus company for me and then he came with me to the bus terminal then he barganed on my behalf and I got a cheaper ticket as the result. He didn't leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I'm getting the right bus to Sabiha airport. I highly recommand him if you want a host who is also your tour guide and freind. Also the prices in the shops are considerably cheaper near his place rather than touristic area like Taksim and you are a 2 TL away from Taksim, so his place is ideal in any sense.",

Несмотря на то, что моя мама не говорит по-английски, Кубилай сумел объяснить ей, где находится хамам и массаж, чем она была очень довольна! Расположение квартиры удобное, добираться до центра легко и недорого с транспортной картой, которую предоставляет Кубилай.

Le rapport qualité prix est très bien selon moi. J'ai pu profiter de la terrasse sur le toit avant qu'il ne fasse trop froid. L'appartement est bien situé, il y a des parcs et des rues marchande pas très loin, les autres rues marchande ne sont pas très loin non plus, j'y allais souvent à pied (Mont Royal que j'aime bien est à 30min de marche). Il y a de bon restaurant et de très bon café à moins de 5 minutes de marche. Le metro est à environ à 10-15 minutes. Il y à aussi une station de vélo et une bonne épicerie à quelque minutes.\r\nLe quartier est sympa, la rue est calme. Pour ceux qui veulent faire du shopping ou du lèche vitrine il faudra surement prendre le metro pour aller un peu plus loin.

        "txt": "Снимали номер с 3 по 9 ноября 2017 втроем - 2 взрослых и ребенок 9 лет. \nМестоположение и район.\nНайти гостиницу очень просто. Если добираетесь сами, то выходить надо на трамвайной остановке Баязит, перейти на другую улицу, найти вывеску Burger King  и по этой улочке идти прямо вниз, никуда не сворачивая, ища вывеску гостиницы (она будет справа). \nТеперь о самом районе. Гостиница находится на торговой и оживленной улице. Первое впечатление - как будто ты попала на рынок, становится тревожно. Но потом уже понимаешь, что собственно это не совсем рынок - это магазины по оптовой торговле обувью. Я несколько раз проходила по этой улочке одна - все нормально - никто меня за руки не хватал, никуда не зазывал - здесь люди торгуют оптом, потому я как покупатель не особо интересна. Прогулка по этой улице до гостиницы занимает минуты 3. Зато поднявшись до трамвайной остановке Баязит, ты попадаешь сразу в исторический центр (Гранд Базар) и можешь прогуляться по одной из самых красивых улиц старого Константинополя. Пешком минут за 10 (может меньше, очень близко) доходим до площади Султанахмет, где в вашем распоряжении сразу несколько достопримечательностей - Храм Святой Софии, Цистерна Базилика, Голубая мечеть, колонны, рядом тоже Дворец Топкапы. Так что в плане местоположения гостиницы - все очень хорошо. И - ночью тихо, никто не мешает спать. В  5 утра кажется проходит молитва - её слышно, но еле-еле, я просто чутко сплю. Мы жили в номере 401 - на верхнем этаже. Из окна открывается вид на Мраморное море со множеством кораблей и крыши соседних домов.\nЗавтраки.\nКаждый день одинаковые, но очень вкусные. Из горячего - яйца, картофель фри, омлет кажется (вроде без молока, не знаю, но вкусно), чай, кофе. Нарезки - огурцы, помидоры, оливки, маслины, 2 вида сыра, колбаса-ветчина, жареные кабачки и перцы, йогурт, хлопья. В кувшинах молоко и еще что-то типа цветного разведенного сока.\nНомер.\nКартинка соответствует полностью нами увиденному. Мебель неновая, но красивая и добротная, и видно, что дорогая. Матрасы толстые и удобные. Белье чистое и не пахнет хлоркой. Могу только добавить, что есть еще мини-бар, чайник электрический и чашки с блюдцами, тройник (поразительно!).  В ванне на троих человек - 5 тюбиков геля и один шампуня, три кусочка мыла и туалетная бумага. Полотенца также предоставляются. Есть сейф, проверили - работает, я так поняла он предоставляется бесплатно....вот только его к шкафу забыли прикрутить -\n спокойно взял под мышку и пошел. Посторонних и неприятных запахов нет.\nВ целом.\nГостиница очень приятная, тихая, уютная. Соотношения цена-качество оптимальное. Рекомендую данную гостиницу.",

The other place was not up to our standards and we requested a refund which he made in cash.  This was kind of him, but still we want things to run smoothly.

We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \n\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \n\nIf you're worried about not having a beach view, don't be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \n\nMahalo, Ralph! We'd stay here again <3",

The nights were quiet except for occasional rains when windows must be closed, there is a fan that keeps things cool and air circulating. This area of the Big Island is lush and tropical and with that beauty comes an abundance of life, so attention must be taken when preparing or storing any kind of food, as the ants will be quick to make an appearance. Sweet Hawi town is nearby with all its charms, and has a lovely Saturday farmer's market under the shade of a massive banyon tree. The fresh organic farm eggs Rev Les left for me were so appreciated, and the kitchen did provide for all I needed to fry them up for a delicious (Website hidden by Airbnb) were the kind and helpful communications I received from Rev Les.

Kihei market was merely a 2 minute walk away as was the surf school where you can rent out paddle boards or surf boards and other gear. Since it is centrally located, driving to other places in Maui was also convenient. \n\nHospitality was outstanding - we knew where we wanted to go but the apt had a Maui guide book on the coffee table for quick reference. There were great amenities to play Music, a nice bookshelf with various reads if you just want to read by the beach and chairs to take to the beach  to relax in between your snorkeling/swimming excursions. \n\nThe views - oh my god. The photos do not do it justice. We had sweeping views of the pacific and saw early morning paddle-boarders, surfers and sea turtles right from the balcony! Im sure if you come during the winter months, you can watch whales literally while drinking your morning coffee. No need to go to an expensive touristy bar to get that perfect Hawaiian sunset :) \n\nI don't know what else to say. Highly recommend for a great time.",

Eating breakfast overlooking a pretty garden and watching the river made a pleasurable start to each day. My bed was comfortable and as promised by my host, big soft towels to use in the shared bathroom.

The heritage house, very well loved by the owners, is all at once comfortable/cosy, charming and full of wonders… some delicious like: fresh herbs, lemon/orange trees growing in the garden. The'Platypus\" bedroom with its timber walls, vintage lacy mosquito net, clean bed linen & soft towels, made us feel very snug. Ann had even placed some fresh lavender stems on our pillows! We explored the island during the day, hanged at the beach… It felt like the time had stopped for a while. Then, coming back to the house, we were welcomed at night by Ann cooking up a FEAST, literally. She put so much thoughts into the menu and what would please us! The dinner with Ann and her husband was lovely and very much fun. Needless to say that we slept like babies. The next day morning brunch was another delicious meal served on the sunny balcony overlooking the vegetation and the river. We left shortly after and felt we could have stayed for a few more days of true pampering!",

After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \r\n\r\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that's all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don't miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \r\n\r\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he's a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam's expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\r\n\r\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \r\n\r\n ",

Since the appartment is in the city center there is no fabulos view from none of the windows - but this does not matter at all.\r\n \r\nThere is also a Nespresso coffee machine in the modern kitchen (bring the capsules by your one or there is a Nespresso shop 100m away).\r\n \r\nWe can fully recomand this special appartment and Lluis as perfect host in this wunderful city.\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!\r\n \r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n\r\n *   * \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDas Appartment ist in unmittelbarer Nähe vom öffentlichen Verkehr und der grossen Einkaufsstrasse \"Passeig de Gràcia\" mit unzähligen Läden, Cafes und Restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeal für einen Sightseeing-Aufenthalt in Barcelona, da zentral gelegen (ca. 10 min zu Fuss zur Plaça Catalunya, 2 min zum Taxi-Stand und Bus-Haltestellen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir waren zu 5. für drei Tage in Lluis Wohnung und haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Lluis war bei der Schlüsselübergabe bereits vor Ort und hat uns gute Tipps für Barcelona gegeben. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Wohnung ist neu renoviert, modern eingerichtet und hat wunderschöne alte Böden und Stuckaturen in manchen Zimmern.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine automatische Lüftung: Die Temperatur kann manuell eingestellt werden (sehr angenehm).\r\n\r\nDer verglaste Raum („Wintergarten“) ist ein zusätzlicher Raum mit Aussicht auf den Innenhof (die Aussicht ist jetzt nicht wirklich atemberaubend, aber es ist sehr gemütlich). Eine schöne Aussicht gibt es von keinem Fenster aus, da sich die Wohnung Mitten in der Stadt befindet - Stört aber nicht.\r\n\r\nEs hat eine Nespresso-Kaffee-Maschine (Kapseln selber mitbringen oder 100m von der Wohnung gibt’s einen Nespresso-Shop).\r\n\r\n\r\nWir können die Wohnung und Lluis als Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen.\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias Lluis!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nMarcella and familiy\r\n",

Yo mismo vivo en un edificio antiguo.el apartamento estaba limpio excepto por la nevera, que tuvimos que limpiarla a fondo\nCalefacción y aire acondicionado. Muy necesarios los dos porque las temperaturas son un poco extremas.\nWiFi muy bueno, Potente (llegaba hasta la parada del autobús) y muy veloz. Televisión con múltiples canales\nLos quince primeros días estuvimos cuatro personas (mis dos hijos) y estuvimos un poco justos (sofá-cama) pero después una pareja, y perfecto.\nLe vendría bien al apartamento una mano de pintura.\nEs tuvimos mes y medio y NYC es maravilloso, el sitio y el apartamento me encanto, salvo pequeñas cosas, y el anfitrion fue muy amable ya que nos dejó hacer el check out a la 1:00 pm.\nLa comunicación fue siempre por email",

The room itself was super clean, comfortable and perfect for a short holiday in Hong Kong. It had everything I needed - AC, little bathroom with shower, fresh towel everyday, shampoo and a big comfortable bed. You also feel really safe as you can only get into the guesthouse and room with a special keycard. The staff was super helpful too and so was Natalie. I only met her in person once, but she is incredibly friendly and really makes sure you have a pleasant stay. I can recommend the guesthouse for those who travel by themselves and need a quiet room to come back to in the midst of bustling Hong Kong. Thanks a lot, Natalie! All the best, Juliana",

It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\r\n\r\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping! Would stay again in a flash!",

I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn't want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it's right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it's a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul's residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn't popping in or out during my stay.  I'm hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul's place is available!",

The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn't your destination, Paul's apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia's campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul's building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn't dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul's apartment is decorated with an artist's eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul's kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul's space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable.

El sofá donde supuestamente se podía dormir, tenía una gran mancha que ni se habían molestado en intentar limpiarla. Solo había un único armario recubierto de moho para guardar la ropa, que evidentemente no pudimos utilizar. La ducha estaba negra, picada y oxidada, lo que nos tocó limpiar a nosotros y desinfectarla un poco para poderla utilizar. La cocina llena cubierta por una capa de grasa que la hacía inútil para cocinar cualquier cosa. Escaleras hacia abajo completamente empinadas y estrechas.  Nada más llegar ni rastro de Regina o Juan, nos atendió una persona que ni siquiera sabía hablar bien castellano, por lo que dudo mucho de la existencia de Juan y Regina. Es absolutamente indignante que cuando pagas el apartamento te cobran unos gastos de limpieza que no han efectuado. Para colmo nos cobraron 30 € en concepto de checking. La zona es tranquila aunque bastante alejada del metro, dado que tienes unas cuestas muy empinadas desde la parada más cernada de metro y luego toca subir cuesta arriba unos 15 minutos. De cara a los esfuerzos por parte del anfitrión, absolutamente ninguno. La persona que nos recibió ni siquiera sabía indicarnos donde estaba la tienda más cercana, un parking donde poder dejar el coche e incluso la parada de metro más cernada.

I have a cat allergy but she was so friendly and hospitable that I even managed to give her a few good pats. Teodora's place is very clean, so my allergic reaction was minimal. \r\n\r\nThe location is great. It's less than a 10 min walk to the Metro and very easy to find street parking. We enjoyed the garden space very much. We sat out there one late afternoon and felt as though we were truly Montreal residents!\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I make (which is NOT a deal breaker) is perhaps a small fan in the guest room. The windows are not very big, and we kept the door closed, to keep Tsitsou out, and it got stuffy pretty quickly. \r\n\r\nI will be giving Teodora a 10/10 and we hope to come back to visit soon!",

The apartment is beautifully appointed, fresh spotless linen, a bowl of fruit, chocolates, and even an array of teabags and biscuits to have with my coffee. Such a lovely surprise. It's a spacious apartment with two beautiful bathrooms and amazing views. Even a large balcony with deck chairs. This apartment truly had everything we needed. There was a chemist near the ground floor doors, and a convenience store as well; coffee shops and cafes are nearby, and an excellent DFO shopping centre nearby (within walking distance; 1.3km I think).

The condo was 100% clean and included everything one may need to prepare meals and have an enjoyable and relaxing stay.

It's the perfect setting for a fun yet peaceful vacation. \nRaj is very responsive and thoughtful as he provided a valuable welcome packet before we arrived. It was put to good use in creating our family's itinerary! \nWe were giddy from the moment we arrived to the family home and found it was exactly as illustrated in the description and more! The views are absolutely AMAZING!!! We spent many hours on the patio simply taking in the spectacular views... The family home is truly lovely and very clean.  We appreciated the notes regarding the access to wifi, the use of the laundry machines in the home, storage of beach supplies, and even check out process. A fabulous host that provided my family with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable!  The check-in process was so easy and convenient, the staff so warm & friendly, wonderful resort amenities. This was our first trip to Maui, and we know we will be back! This is largely due to our memorable experience staying here! \nRaj-- a huge MAHALO for sharing your beautiful home with us. Can't wait to come back! ",

It is modern and nicely decorated. The kitchen is basically equipped, don't expect to cook there but you have everything for breakfast (do buy/bring tea and coffee). The \r\nbedroom is comfortable.

Her place was extremely clean and cozy, and has a really friendly cat who only comes around every now and then. The bed was so comfortable .. lol. The area is perfect, you can literally go up one block and you're on a street with so many restaurants. (5 Napkin Burger is amazing. Otto's Tacos are perfect for a late night snack.) Central Park and Times Square were only about a 15-20 minute walk, and the surrounding streets were really quiet. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a short, comfortable, fun  and inexpensive NYC stay. Thank you for everything Karen, you're a great host. ",

They always responded me in a swift manner with good solutions to all of my minor issues (including the early arrival, coffee machine repair, cleaning service question and light bulb request). \nI liked the apartment very much. It was convenient to do anything in the city and quiet and comfortable to sleep at night. To highlight the convenience, I want to note that the nearest supermarket is just one or two blocks away (to the north) and pubs and restaurants are also a block away (to the south). Some may worry about bugs at such location, but during my 40-day stay, I did not have any bug issues. \nThe only possible setbacks I can think of are the tiny kitchen sink and occasional odor from outside. \nThe kitchen sink is certainly small although this place has a dishwasher. So, for a short stay and people who do not cook very much will not have any problems. However, if you want to do dishes during your stay, you will probably find the sink space cramped. \nThe outside smell was very occasional during my stay in a rainy summer (I think it was related to the weather). When I noticed the weird smell, I just needed to close the windows to shut it out. The AC works very well. So, it was not a big deal for me to do so. \nOverall, I am happy with the values and qualities I got here, and I would highly recommend this place to anybody who wants to enjoy the city activities and have good rests in the same time.",

We could not even manage to watch starred TV.. & it was more frustrating to also realise that most of the Foxtel channels were not subscribed to, therefore there isn't anything PLATNIUM about this packgage! This is not a 1br, it is an older style, but externally refurbished block, there was no room to move & even if we did get the TV working, there was no chance of watching it due to the dining setting blocking the view.

The location is central to driving to Kihei, Lahaina, Paia or Kahalui. One of the best places my family has stayed.  There are charming ducks and chickens roaming around on the property - the only slight downside was the great amount of duck poop on the porch every morning but it was an easy cleanup with the outside hose.

Property itself looks even better than in the pictures and it is quite large. House is very nice and you will probably find everything you need even though if you plan to cook every day you might be somewhat limited. Biggest problem we encountered is something that looked cool at the beginning - ducks walking around the property. They would constantly poop at the front deck and the deck would quickly become disgusting and unusable. Even if you wash it out with the hose, it will take them no time to make the mess again. However, somehow they decided to leave the back (ocean side) deck alone so we were able to truly enjoy the beautiful view.  I would recommend the place to couples or families with older children - not babies or small kids as the bedrooms are awkwardly placed (one is right at the entrance door) so you have to walk through the whole house to get to second bedroom. The host vas very helpful and responded quickly to all our questions.\n",

The ducks and chickens were a fun addition to the property (though they did poop all over the entryway). \n\nUnfortunately, there were some difficulties that were hard to overlook particularly at this price point. The general house cleanliness was quite poor.. floors were super dusty and needed a good mopping. Some of the kitchenware had crusty dust or rust on them. Other things were broken.. kitchen/scissors/blenders/glassware/kitchen gas downdraft. Also, only the living room ac worked, the bedrooms got rather hot. We really weren't expecting these issues at this price point hence the 3* review. \n\nThe house had a lot of geckos. We expected these outside or on the deck- but we spotted these just about everywhere you don't want to see one... in the bathroom, on our towels, on our clothes, on the chair, on the bed.",

The location is good- the town is meh (no good restaurants), but you are right in the middle of Kihei and Wailea- both are 15 minutes away.  The kitchen is perfect for cooking and is well stocked.  It says it has a hot tub and it does, but it is attached to the other unit on the property and we felt weird as their outdoor shower is right there.  I was concerned about the other unit on the property as we didn’t rent it, but we never saw anyone (just their car)- and it is a huge property so you don’t even realize it is there.  \n\nHonestly if you are looking for a beautiful home right on the water- this place is more than perfect.",

Jesse and Kris have been very responsive to my concerns and made sure things were properly communicated. \n\nSpecial thanks to Kris who has been so accommodating and approachable.\n\nGood points:\n1) Apartment is conveniently located near MTR exit (less than 5-min walk)\n2) A nearby supermarket to get your daily needs like water\n3) A LOT of restaurants nearby including local eateries. There's even a Korean resto! (Seng Seng)\n4) Strong water supply with instant hot water\n5) Comfy beds and pillows\n6) Well-equipped kitchen with a complete set of glassware\n7) Umbrellas. It was raining on our 2nd day and the umbrellas came in handy.\n\nRoom for improvement:\n1) Directions on how to get to the meeting place e.g. which exit to take from MTR exit as there were lots of exits\n2) Standardised ON/OFF light switches\n3) Working clock in at least one of the rooms, if not all\n\nThanks again Jessa and Kris! We would definitely recommend your apartment/s to our families and friends.",

Our room and bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable for our family of three.  The internet worked well and her rooftop terrace was pleasant for afternoon tea and breakfast.  In fact, Nuria offered us tea on the roof upon our arrival.  We enjoyed having use of the kitchen during our stay.  The elevator in her building was nice for carrying luggage up and down.  Our Spanish and Nuria’s English were minimal, but we were able to communicate.  This is certainly not a luxurious place, but good for those traveling within a budget.   ",

Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until 10pm, but I was able to notify her through (Hidden by Airbnb) just before we took off and she was fine about it. She  has a small VW Pollo which we just managed to fit all 3 of our big bags in to, plus us 3 and Nuria! She pointed out the closest metro station (Lesseps) on the way to her house and made us tea on the Terrace upon arrival to her home. She doesn't speak English so we communicated in Spanish. The room was fine for us, a very narrow apartment, as are most apartments in Barcelona. A small lift was good to take our luggage up as the apartment is the top of 6 or so levels. We had a fan in our room and a big open window which was great as it was hot! Shower is either hot or cold and bathroom shared with another guest room. Towels provided. Showers between 7:00 and 22:00 as bathroom is inbetween the 2 guest rooms and that rule is to help keep noise levels to a minimum for any guests who might prefer to sleep from 10pm. Approx 15 mins walk to Park Guell which was great! And about 25 mins walk to La Sagrada Familia. A really great fruit/vegetable/organic produce with the best of everything just a few streets away. Access to fridge available on request. Access to cutlery, crockery and microwave (not oven or stove). Great strong wifi connection. A few barking dogs in the neighborhood, but otherwise quiet. Nuria kindly offered for us to leave our luggage for the day as we were checking out, but we didn't need to. Nuria seemed to do a bit of work from home, she kept out of our way, but was around if we had needed to ask her anything. Over all our stay was good. Muchas Gracias Nuria!",

The thing is that you won't want to spend that much time there because the neighborhood is amazing--which was also accurately advertised. We walked or took the metro everywhere and never used our car (we lucked out and found a parking spot right after the street had been cleaned and all the other cars had to move). There are so many great restaurants, cafes and boutiques nearby, and also a sweet park right at the top of the street. We walked to Mont Royal (and then walked to the top for an amazing view), and walked to the Metro stop to get to downtown (for free concerts at the Jazz Festival), the old port, and the Jean Talon market. Also, Libby was very helpful and available via email (and if my phone worked, I assume text as well); has lots of maps and brochures in the apartment for you to look at and use; and her housecleaner, who met us and gave us the keys, was lovely and full of tips about the city.

The kitchen is very small but it's well set out so there is still plenty of bench space. Being on a high floor the hot water doesn't run for particularly long but it's fine if you leave a bit of time between showers. Checking in and out was super easy! The building is in a wonderful location, we walked easily to Haymarket, Darling Harbour, the Rocks, and Circular Quay. TIP: If you are driving into the city, this is not the place to stay. Parking was a nightmare. Jared does warn that parking is expensive (he mentions $69 in the apartment description) but what I didn't realise is it's not just a $69 flat rate for more than three hours, it's $69 the first day, $50 overnight, then $69 for the next day. In the end we just gave up trying to find cheaper parking and paid. Other than that our stay was wonderful. Thank you Jared for being a wonderful host! ",

        "txt": "Margarida es una persona atenta y siempre dispuesta a ayudar; Oporto una ciudad hermosa llena de rincones en los que perderse. Lamentablemente, es difícil llevarse una imagen positiva después de que te roben. El día antes de nuestra partida encontramos la luna del coche rota, y todo lo que había de valor, sustraído. Es una práctica habitual, no fue una excepción. La consiguiente desesperación, al estar \"abandonados\" en otro país, sólo la conoce quien la padece. Además, no habíamos aparcado en una zona  conflictiva, sino en un barrio residencial, muy cerca del apartamento. \nLo verdaderamente problemático no es el robo en sí, sino el hecho, ante la perspectiva de un largo viaje para volver a casa, de no tener ayuda posible: que el seguro no responda, no tener internet en el teléfono, etcétera, hecho que probablemente constituya un incentivo para los ladrones, pues es obvio que actúan desde el rencor.\nSi Margarida dispone el aparcamiento trasero a la casa todo será más seguro. No le recomiendo a nadie dejar el coche en la calle.\nEs recomendable también, controlar los precios de las tarifas de datos, ya que la Wi-Fi que nos fue brindada solo funcionó el primer día, y se hace muy necesaria estando de viaje. \nPor otro lado, es difícil llegar a entender para un español (que tenemos fama de fiesteros y gritones) como es posible que en una zona residencial todas las noches se reúna gente en una plaza a beber y hablar hasta las cuatro o cinco de la mañana. El caso es que como la visita ha sido en agosto y el calor era insoportable, teníamos que tener las ventanas abiertas y era muy difícil dormir, pues la gente no tenía ninguna consideración ni civismo en este aspecto.\nEsto no pretende ser una crítica destructiva; quizá tuvimos mala suerte, y aunque creo que hay aspectos a mejorar, el apartamento es una  buena oportunidad para conocer la ciudad, sobre todo por su relación calidad-precio y porque Margarida responde siempre con una sonrisa. Aun teniendo en cuenta los aspectos señalados, estoy seguro de que con el tiempo el recuerdo será bueno.",

On the day of check in, Boris was so kind and he ensured we were able to find the flat and even waited outside the building for us (as the Airbnb direction was incorrect- please be sure to use the address provided by your host). Boris provided suggestions on where to go and places to eat. While there is no washer in the unit, overall a wonderful stay in magical Porto. Btw, there is a really delicious sandwich shop around the neighborhood that serves up cheap but yummy pork sandwiches right by the park. You won't miss it as there's always a long line. ",

My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay in Willy's apartment and we wish we could return.\r\n\r\nWe booked this place almost last minute as I had to move to New York to start a job and look at apartments. We're glad we went with this one. It is half a block away from the R and only a few blocks from basically every other subway line worth having in Brooklyn. We could be in Manhattan in a minute's notice. \r\n\r\nIt is only a few blocks away from Montague St, the short shopping street in the middle of Brooklyn Heights, and a little farther away from Court St, the main shopping street this side of the Gowanus Canal. In short, the location is ideal. Don't pass this place up.\r\n\r\nThe apartment itself is spacious and light. The main room/bed room has two windows on three of its four walls and is constantly filled with light. The girl who lives there is a photographer, and it is obvious that she cares about the quality of the light in the room. To top it off, the apartment is appropriately accented with a few mirrors, which brightens the space even more. The bed, with its foam and vinyl mattress, is an absolute pleasure to sleep on. \r\n\r\nThose who come to New York fearing about grime and pests need not be afraid of this apartment. It is kept immaculately clean, and we stayed there ten days without seeing even a single fly. \r\n\r\nSheets and towels are provided, as well as a mostly empty closet and lots of reading material. The internet in the apartment has its ups and downs, but is mostly and unfortunately fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you would be a fool to pass this place up, especially at this price. ",

While there were a couple of quirks, they weren't substantial in any way and the price was more than 50% less than nearby hotels.  The lighting in the place is stunning and the building tends to be very quiet.  Getting the keys was not a problem.  We had a bit of trouble getting in to the building a couple of times, but that was resolved with the help of a friendly neighbor who was our designated contact since the host is away.  The door to the apartment was a difficult to unlock as well, but that may have been my error.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would very highly recommend staying at Willy's place.

But it is the perfect setup and the PERFECT location if you want to be in the heart of Brooklyn Heights. There is a desk in the bedroom and an Internet connection (not perfect, but mostly worked) so I was able to get some work done too.  Willy was delightful to interact with - accommodating and prompt. After exchanging mobile numbers, we were able to text back and forth, which is very efficient. The bathroom sink turned out to be completely clogged but Willy got a plumber to fix it the next day. She met the plumber there and dealt with the situation, so it was no trouble at all for us. Definitely recommend.",

The views of the ocean were amazing, the resort is well kept and the landscaping is beautiful. Turtles were in the ocean at the edge of the property every morning, and we were usually able to scurry down with coffee or a mimosa and watch them swim and come up for air. The pool was rarely, if ever, used during our stay, so you could have it all to yourself. The BBQ are was clean and well-kept. This condo is on the third floor with stairs up, so if you have physical limitations it might be a struggle. However, the third floor placement allows for extremely quieter accommodations and an unparrelleled view of the ocean. The bedroom is on the street side, so road noise does creep in during the evenings. We easily slept and the noise didn't bother us at all. The fans and open windows kept us cool during the evenings with no need for AC (this unit does not have it). Although we didn't meet Ken in person, he provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy the condo without worry. This place is well stocked, clean and convenient. Highly recommended.",

Two advisories: the condo is on the small side for more than two people, although it can technically sleep four (two in the real bed and two on the pullout couch), and careful with parking here because other guests and owners can get a bit possessive, especially if they have large cars. Also, you definitely should have a car if you stay here because while a few markets/delis and shops are walkable, the town of Lahaina is not. I heartily recommend this wonderful clean condo!",

When something needed fixing, he was there immediately with his handyman, who is also very sweet and helpful. The apartment is just like in the photos, though it is hard to capture how awesome it is to sit on the terrace and watch the birds and (on some nights) fireworks in the sky.\n\nThe air conditioning is in two rooms, the living/dining room and the master bedroom. This was plenty for the time we were there, but I bet it gets hot in August in the smallest bedroom. The kitchen could use a few more plates and utensils, as a family of four ended up doing lots of dishes, but that is minor.\nThe neighborhood is quite nice, shops and restaurants and groceries everywhere. The buses, tram, and taxis are at most a couple of blocks away, and the subway an extra block in the other direction.

As it was our first airbnb experience we were a bit nervous, however it turned out to be a dream holiday. \r\nWe arrived at the flat and were met by Lola (the building guard) who gave us the keys and showed us around the apartment. It was perfect. Clean and tastefully decorated with all the kitchen appliances you could need! \r\nWe chose the apartment for the balcony and views and were blown away. You can see the whole of Barcelona from the balcony, all the way to the sea. Perfect for a sunny evening with a bottle of wine! The best thing about the balcony is that you are not overlooked by anyone. It is completely private and being so high up you are not disturbed by the noise of the road. \r\nThe flat itself is about a 10 minute walk from the metro station Guinardo and it's only a couple of minutes on the metro into town. The metro shuts around midnight so a few late nights we treated ourselves to a taxi back which cost about $11.\r\nLots of little supermarkets nearby to stock up and also several nice bars and cafes if you dont fancy the journey into town. \r\nAll in all was a perfect trip. Fantastic apartment which was great value for money. Would 100% recommend Enriques apartment and will certainly be staying again in the future.  ",

And we realized that it was quite difficult to find such place in Barcelona.  But Patricia's apartment was exactly what we were looking for.  It's located in Gracia disctrict which is 5 minutes walk from Passage de Gracia (one of the main streets of Barcelona which brings you to the Cataloniya square).  But at the same time it's a district where local people leave and it has a charm old Barcelona - historical buildings, nice cosy squares full of life, plenty of food shops and even market with fresh sea food, vegetables and Spanish specialities.  This is exactly the place where you can feel the real, not turistic Barcelona.  We felt very comfortable and safe there.  The apartment is simple but has everything you need - 2 big comfortable bads, kitchen with oven, microwave and all the necessary utensils.  There is also washing machine but we did not use it.  In one of sleeping rooms there is a small cosy balcony where you can enjoy your glass of wine or breakfest.  Due to the fact that both sleeping-rooms windows looks to the patio, it's absolutely quiet at night.  And you can only hear a sound of old clock which goes from the clocktower on the neighboring square which is the main square of Gracia district.  That gives you a wonderfull feeling of being in another century.  So, we got all we have expected and even more:).  And Patricia was also great as host.  We had only one problem with wi-fi in the first day which she fixed immediately that day.  It was very easy and comfortable for us to communicate with Patricia.  So, we would recommend her appartment to those who want to enjoy real Barcelona in a comfortable and quiet way:). ",

I had to message the management service to find out any information and was only told someone was on the way - but no time indication.\nWe asked where would we find a grocery store and again Louisa did not have this information, nor recommendations. \nThe door to the apartment jammed and she could not get it opened, luckily my husband was able to 'pound' on the door to help us get in. When we tested the door to get out of the apartment again, she was unable to open the door. If my husband had not been with me, I or any women would not be able to get in or out of the apartment. Louisa said she would report this problem and hopefully, it will be resolved before the next people arrive. \nI would recommend this apartment when visiting Porto for location, and general facilities in the apartment.

Both Alexia and Denis were fluent in English and French, and we would engage in lively discussions on anything from politics to vegetarian recipes to Mario Kart (be warned: Alexia is prepared to defend her championship title on the last one!) On the flip side, they are also perfectly fine giving you space whenever you wish to rest or simply avoid social interaction.\nAs for the listing itself, parking was readily available on the street and the location was an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station.

As other reviewers have written - as this is an attic apartment, the floors in the bedrooms and bathroom are sloped, making it difficult to maneuver comfortably.  The bedrooms also get quite stuffy.  It would also be helpful for future guests to know that you will need to pick up the keys from the neighboring restaurant, Otto Cihangir.  ",

They don't speak English, but are very charming and helpful, so we communicated via (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate, using (Hidden by Airbnb) .\n\nThe building is slightly older. One day there was no water in the building due to maintenance. The hosts warned me about this, there was nothing they could do and I was prepared. Only issue is that after the water came back, because of the older pipes, it was brown for a little while, just have to let the taps run for several minutes. \n\nThe bed isn't the most comfortable for an extended stay (I was there for eight nights), but for short durations it's fine. \n\nThere is a washing machine in the apartment, it works great, I dried my clothes by hanging them on chairs, hooks, etc. \n\nThe WiFi is strong and reliable. \n\nThere is a grocery store and a couple of reasonably priced restaurants on the block, as well as two different banks. Excellent for visitors. A drug store is also available on the next block at the corner. \n\nOverall the inconveniences were small and the positives of this location was great. ",

She responded to everything and does actually live close by (a good thing too, because the door code wasn't working when we arrived, but it was quickly addressed).  She was also helpful in giving us a bit of extra time for check-out.\n\nJust to say a couple things about the actual condo, the pictures do portray it in the best possible light.  Nothing deceptive, but there are elements that could use updating that are not shown.  The bathrooms need some TLC and there are lots of wires and cords everywhere (especially the bedrooms).  Everything else was clean and safe.  The kitchen is up-to-date with every appliance you should need, including a blender and toaster.  There is a newer washer and dryer right in the unit, which is very convenient.  We didn't use the TVs, but there are 3 of them - one in the main living room and one in each bedroom.  Parking was very convenient - a reserved spot that's just steps away from the ground level entrance (the condo is on the ground level and doesn't have any stairs).  There are several beach accessories waiting as well - a cooler, beach chairs and boogie boards are there for your use, along with plenty of beach towels.  There are 3 AC units and all of them worked, but they are noisy.\n\nThe noise level outside was generally good.  There were a few inconsiderate very early morning departures from other units, but nothing major.  The park across the road closes at 8pm, so there was no late-night noise to speak of.\n\nThe location in general is great.  The park across the road is not a swimming beach (no sand, too many rocks), but it's very popular for surfing and paddleboarding lessons.  There are several sandy beaches just a short drive (or healthy walk) away.  Kihei in general is a great spot to stay, as it's near several  great beaches (Big Beach in Makena is epic) and is central to a lot of things you'll want to see - the upscale Wailea area is just a short drive away and several other destinations are easily driveable from Kihei.  There are lots of food choices close by and many of them offer some of the best value you'll find in Maui.  There's also 2 supermarkets right down the road (and Foodland is open until 1am).\n\nTo summarize, the condo was more \"rustic\" than we were expecting, but I will say that in the area, you'd likely have to pay a bit more for something more updated that has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.",

Her place is very centrally located in Kihei: directly next to the surf/paddleboard rental, 5 min. walking distance from a shopping village, & in the middle of the island, which is nice if you plan on doing the drives to Mt. Haleakala or the Road to Hana. Safeway is a short ~5 min. drive & Costco & the airport are a ~30 minute drive away. Her place has everything you need: kitchen, washer/dryer, beach towels/chairs, nice outdoor patio with a nice, small pool. I highly recommend her place if you want a quiet, quaint, peaceful place to relax where everything you need is a short distance away.

It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!

The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend.",

The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible.

Communication vraiment facile. Séjour sans encombres. \r\n\r\nLes jouets, les livres pour enfants, ainsi que le mobilier pour bébé (chaise haute, baignoire, lit parapluie) ont vraiment été la bonne surprise qui nous a permis d'organiser notre séjour en toute simplicité.\r\n\r\nNous recommandons chaudement cet appartement pour une famille.

It is also within easy reach of two central metro lines although we never once used public transport instead opting to rent bikes from a nearby rental shop (Barcelona is simply one of the best cities to ride in with you pretty much never having having to ride on the road ever!). In any case the main sites of the city are all within easy reach on foot. Its’s a 20 min walk to Place de Catalunya and Gothic Quarters and we very much enjoyed our gentle stroll’s home after a night of eating and drinking. \r\n \r\nSophie herself could not have been more accommodating. She’s was great to communicate with on the lead up to our stay and welcoming on our arrival. We didn’t want for anything on the trip at all. \r\n\r\nIf you book this apartment you will not be disappointed! ",

We visited over the last week of December and the city's Christmas lights were beautiful. \n\nThe heating system was very efficient and no problems with hot water supply.  Fully double-glazed windows and bedroom windows are double-double glazed so no problem with road noise.  Although only on the first floor there is a small lift for those who may find it difficult to climb stairs with a suitcase.\n\nFor those interested, the apartment is directly opposite the Egyptian Museum.\n\nHeike was a friendly and efficient host and solved a problem with one of the keys overnight for us.\n\nWe really enjoyed our stay at Vela apartment and would recommend to others seeking a classy apartment in a great location in this amazing city.\n\n\n\n",

We had a slight issue with the internet on day 2 which again was dealt with promptly and efficiently. \n\nThe apartment is tastefully decorated and appointed to a high standard and it was also very comfortable. We felt very much at home. \n\nOn the first night we noticed a little traffic noise  ( as was expected from a city centre location) but this was significantly minimized when the outer shutters and inner ornate shutters were closed. \n\nThe apartment is located in a lovely spot, very central but a block or so away from where the main tourist congregations.  We enjoyed exploring the city away from the bulk of the tourists. \n\nI would definitely recommend this apartment.",

Как оказалось, мои волнения были напрасны: Али замечательный хозяин, подробно ответил на все мои вопросы, объяснил как добраться от аэропорта до квартиры, без проблем встретил меня в 02:00 (я прилетела поздно ночью). Моя комната оказалась маленькой, но уютной с красивым окошком, выходящим в небольшой зеленый сад. Что касается удобств, то здесь достаточно скромно, но есть все необходимое: хорошее соотношение цены и качества. Сама квартира находится в очень хорошем месте: это небольшая спокойная улица всего в 2 минутах ходьбы от улицы Истикляль, где расположено великое множество магазинов, кафе и ресторанов на любой вкус и кошелек. Рядом метро и остановки общественного транспорта. Также неподалеку находится Галатская башня, музеи, рыбный рынок, можно легко добраться до района Фатих (пешком через Галатский мост всего за 15-20 минут). Мои соседи оказались очень приветливыми, дружелюбными и позитивными ребятами, мне было легко и приятно общаться в ними, даже не смотря на мой ужаснейший английский)) Подводя итог, хочу сказать, что моя поездка удалась на все 500%, и выбор данного места сыграл немаловажную роль: здесь можно с головой окунуться в атмосферу удивительного Стамбула, забыть о том, что ты турист и просто наслаждаться этим великолепным городом. Уже задумалась о моей следующей поездке в Стамбул!\nОгромное спасибо, Али! Больше гостей и больше друзей в твоем доме :)",

Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer.

Attention au stationnement qui peut revenir cher si vous ne chercher pas bien.

Max $4/day for unlimited bus rides and no parking hassles what-so-ever!  (Read reviews for car rental at OGG and you'll find another great reason for going car-free! Not recommended, however, if you wish to do inner island sight-seeing such as Haleakala or Road to Hana.) There is parking under the building.\n\nSafeway is 2 blocks away and fabulous Baby Beach is a 10 minute walk. BTW, Baby Beach is spectacular. Easily the clearest water I've ever snorkeled in. Swim between circular coral outcroppings to see tropical fish and sea turtles. At low tide, wade out hundreds of yards and the water is not even waist high.  Kaanapali Beach - miles of sand, waves and tiki bars is just a half hour walk north or 12 minute bus ride. Easy to get to Black Rock for more superior snorkeling.\n\nComfortable Murphy bed in the living room lets you sleep to gentle breezes and the sound of the ocean. Nice (and very clean) pool area overlooking the ocean is the perfect spot to see sea turtles feeding at dawn and dusk. Very helpful manager on site who will take you out snorkeling, if you just ask.\n\nEvery appliance and amenity you need for a relaxing vacation.  Can't wait to go back!",

This part of Brooklyn is what New York is all about, a real mix, I would recommend it to anyone that is deciding between staying in  Manhattan or elsewhere outside the big apple. Jon has been very responsive throughout the period we secure the property. Even when his oven stopped working - which was a big deal for us - he told us in advance and managed to secure an alternative, which we finally decided not to use (hope that's ok Jon). My only comment that I think could improve anyone's stay in the future is a mini map of the house pointing to where the basics are, what to use and what not to. It is almost self intuitive, but for someone that was using the service for the first time, I had lots of questions at the very beginning. Can I use this?, do you mind if we eat that?, in any case as I said Jon was always very responsive despite being away in the busiest annual holiday of the year.",

Недалеко от метро (рядом метро и автобусы), пляжа, музеев, парков и вокзалов. Удобно что рядом находится много магазинов, ресторанчиков и рынок Бокерия. \n2) Квартира чистая, просторная, 2 удобные комнаты где помещается 3 человеческие (обгорелые после пляжа, напившиеся сангрии и наевшиеся хамона) особи. В каждой комнате вместительные шкафы, спасительный вентилятор и кровать. Просторная кухня где можно приготовить только что купленного на рынке тунца (креветки, мидии) и там же большой стол где поместятся все и всё. Обычный душ и туалет (совмещённый). Человек-сосед с дрелью не обнаружен, спали с открытыми окнами вполне спокойно, и шумели на улице какие-то строители за неделю только 1 раз. \n3) Кошки. Все любителям кошек сюда. 2 классных игручих создания приятно дополнять отдых. Если у вас сильная аллергия на кошек, то решайте сами. \n4) Хозяйка. Алёна – отличный человек с которым за неделю очень сдружились. Дала много полезных советов о Барселоне. Приятный собеседник. \nЕсли (когда) поедем ещё раз, обязательно вернёмся в эту квартиру. \nМинусы. \n- Дверь в туалет не закрывается на ключ. Решается тем что стучишься прежде чем войти. \n- Нет кондиционера. Но за эти деньги есть только вентилятор и губозакатывающее устройство. \nИтого: Снимайте отличная квартира по соотношению цена качество. 10 Елен Летучих из 10.",

My colleague and I stayed there for two nights whilst on business and it was so much nicer that the normal corporate apartment - but still had all the small touches you expect (bath robes, toiletries, hair dryer, etc...). It would also be a perfect place to stay for a pleasure. The location is great - right in the Woollahra village - and close to the city. Louise has exquisite taste and the apartment is decorated with a lot of style and panache.  She was an excellent host who communicated with me swiftly and effectively - our check-in was completely hassle free - and we were welcomed with fresh bread, fruit, and milk. We will definitely look to stay here again and highly recommend it to the airbnb community. ",

Before I started with the inside of the apartment, like any property the most important is location, location and location. Evan & Maria's apartment is located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a walking distance to the Rockefeller Plaza and also to Times Square. There are several restaurants near the apartment and a deli just around the corner to get anything you wanted. \n\nOkay, now we begin with the apartment. It is very beautiful. Not only you can get anything you wanted but also you can tell the owner put a lot of their heart in to it. It is beautifully decorated and also very clean. \n\nOn a personal note, we have the booking wrong, so we have to checked out a day earlier than we intended to. Evan and Maria were very nice and courteous about it. He texted us to let us know that we have to check out and patiently await our arrival, since we're on a ferry to Liberty Island, and help us find a hotel to move.\n\nAll and all it was a great experience even with the moving around and one thing for sure, if I ever in NY I will most definitely try to book Even and Maria super homey apartment.\n\nThank you Evan & Maria and good luck with the baby ...\n\nyours truly,\n\nThe De Haans",

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos: impeccably clean, modern, updated and cozy.  The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and provided a restful nights sleep after long days exploring the city.  Our adult daughter slept on the futon, and she was in heaven!  There were extra pillows, sheets and a comforter in the closet, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that she was more comfortable here than in the hotel room we stayed at during our first half of our trip.  The apartment had everything we needed: dishes, Keurig coffee and coffee maker (my #1 priority!), iron, hair dryer and much, much more!  There was a fantastic bottle of Pinot Noir that I thoroughly enjoyed and a jar full of Hershey's kisses (which we ate entirely too many of)!  Evan and Maria thought of everything; there is even an iPhone charger to use!  For NYC, it was very quiet and peaceful, which came as a pleasant and unexpected surprise to us.  The location can't be beat, close to great restaurants, parks,  & subways.  I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but let me end by saying that this apartment is so great that I want to live in it!  In fact, our daughter hopes to relocate to the city soon, and she took note of just how well Evan and Maria utilized the space and all the most wonderful details.  Well done.  Bravo!!!",

Laundry is 10 blocks away since the hostess isn't in town, the sheets may not be clean so you'll have to do them yourself. Maria is always available via text so very helpful. If you drive, underground parking is a block away. Rental bikes are also close by. I would definitely stay there again for a quick weekend visit to Montreal.",

This was my first time using an airbnb apartment and I enjoyed feeling I was \"at home\" rather than at a hotel. I also really liked the neighbourhood. I felt that I was living among the locals and enjoyed picking up coffee in the local pastry shops. Although the apartment is located pretty close to the Sagrada Familia, I didn't feel I was in a touristy area. The apartment is very close to a couple of metro lines, and we used the metro a lot. It was fast and efficient -- and got us wherever we wanted to go in the city. ",

She stopped communicating with us and then tried to lock us out of the house one night when we went back. Thankfully we found an open window, got in, evacuated our belongings immediately and had to pay for a hotel for the rest of the honeymoon. Completely outrageous.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the place was disappointing. It smells like mildew and she doesn't have screens on many windows so you're stuck in a mildewy sauna. I would not recommend it and would advise people to be extremely careful with Kandy.",
